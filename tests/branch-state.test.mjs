// The incident this comes from is one where every check was correct and nobody
// read the failing one (BACKLOG §126), so what matters here is that the reader
// DISTINGUISHES: green, red, still-running and could-not-look are four answers,
// and three of them are not a clean bill. Every arm is driven through the `run`
// seam, so this test needs no network, no remote and no `gh` (CLAUDE.md §7, §9).
